# Chess - Still work in progress

This is a chess game created from scratch using Pyglet. I used View, Model, Controller architecture as the base for constructing the game. I then created the piece parent class and had its children be each of the different kinds of chess pieces. The piece class handles the properties of each piece and handles the logic for deciding what moves are legal.

Future Plans: 
-Improved UI
-Creation of a computer capable of playing better than ~2000 rating
-Adding difficulty settings for the chess computer
